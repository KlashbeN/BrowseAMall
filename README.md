####Scope of your project/Overview: 

This project aims to create a user-friendly experience in browsing the different malls and stores in Singapore with an all-in-one browsing 
experience in the same website.An iOS application will also becreated which allows users to easily browse mall information and navigate
inside the mall, finding their stores of interest. 

####Features done
Currently, we have done the navigation bar, search tool for different malls and one mall page. We have also done up the banner image.
We have also setup the email accounts needed.

####Planned features
Our team hopes to add more malls to the website. 
Also, we plan to add in the carpark rates of the malls to allow people to have easy reference and access to them.
Once we have the website done, we would like to implement an iOS application with similar features found on the website.
We would also touch up on the store search feature which is currently buggy.
One click login to forums with social network accounts will also be implemented.

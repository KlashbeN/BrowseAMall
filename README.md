* Features in Browse Page
	* Search tool for different malls. This would lead the user to the different mall page. 
	* Currently, we have mall pages for Vivo City, Ngee Ann City, Ion Orchard and Raffles City.
	* Each mall page would contain informations about the mall. These informations range from a guide to location, the mall's opening hours and contact number and shop directory. 
	* The shop directory uses a search function where user enters the shop they would like to enquire and it would show the user the shop's name, unit and contact number. This would allow the users to be able to contact with the shop and also know where the shop is located in the mall. 
	* Google Maps is used to provide users the directions to get to the place and a guide to the mall's vicinity. Users can also key in their starting location and get directions to the place using Google Maps. With this feature, it would allow users to be able to know how to get there using different modes of transport.
